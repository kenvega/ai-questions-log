question
  does react-testing-library depends on jsdom?
  can it run tests without it?

response
  short answer
    no—React Testing Library (RTL) doesn’t depend on jsdom. It depends on having a DOM environment
    jsdom is just the most common way to provide one in Node.

  What that means in practice:

    Works without jsdom if you run tests in a real browser
      e.g., Playwright Component Testing, Cypress Component Testing, Karma, Web Test Runner.
      RTL runs directly against the browser’s DOM.

    Also works without jsdom in Node if you use an alternative DOM
      e.g., happy-dom (Vitest supports environment: 'happy-dom').
      Other options exist (e.g., linkedom), but jsdom/happy-dom are the usual picks.

    Won’t work with “no DOM at all”
      @testing-library/react renders into document.body and needs window/document.
      If you’re only unit-testing pure functions, you can use a Node env
        but for RTL component tests you need some DOM implementation.
