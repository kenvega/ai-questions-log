question
  when a component re-renders because of a state change
    the child also re-renders even though it doesn't have anything to do with that state?

  can you make an example with a child that is very slow to render because of compute power
  or maybe a child that has animation so that i can see if a re-render occurs when a parent state changes?

response
  Yes. Parent state changes trigger a new parent render
  By default, all children render too.
    Prevent with React.memo, stable props (useMemo/useCallback), or by moving state down.
