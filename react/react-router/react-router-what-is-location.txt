question
  in react router what is the concept of location

response
  Location is "an entry in history stack"
    contains information about the URL path and 

    it's not just a string URL

    it's an object with properties that describes URL-like parts
      plus some router-specific metadata

    example of location
      { pathname: string, search: string, hash: string, state: any, key: string }

    it is based on window.location that represents “where the user is at.”

    useLocation() returns the current Location

  When a “new location” is created

    A new location entry is pushed or replaced in the history stack when you do things like:
      Navigate to a different pathname (e.g., /users → /users/42).
      Change the search (query string) (e.g., ?page=1 → ?page=2).
      Change the hash (e.g., #top → #details).
      Push to the same URL again (programmatically) with a different state or just a new entry—this produces a new key, so it’s a distinct location even if the address bar looks identical
