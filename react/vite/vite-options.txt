question
  when creating a react project with typescript using vite i get three options
    TypeScript
    TypeScript + React Compiler
    TypeScript + SWC

  what are the differences between these options?

response

  TypeScript

    Uses the standard React plugin for Vite: @vitejs/plugin-react (Babel-based Fast Refresh, plus esbuild for TS transpile).

    It’s the most compatible path and lets you add Babel plugins later (like the React Compiler).

  TypeScript + React Compiler

    Same as above but preconfigured to run the React Compiler (via the Babel plugin babel-plugin-react-compiler).

    The compiler analyzes your components/hooks and automatically memoizes work where it’s safe, aiming for fewer re-renders.

    Works best with React 19; there’s a runtime for 17/18 if needed.

    Enabling it means you’re running an extra Babel transform (a small build-time overhead).

  TypeScript + SWC

    Uses @vitejs/plugin-react-swc (Rust-based SWC instead of Babel) for faster dev startup and HMR on big projects.

    Trade-off: Babel plugins don’t apply here so the React Compiler isn’t natively part of this template
      (there are ongoing efforts/notes about SWC support, but the official compiler runs as a Babel plugin)


  Practical picks

    Want maximum speed and you’re not using Babel plugins?
      Pick TypeScript + SWC.

    Want the new auto-memoization goodies out of the box?
      Pick TypeScript + React Compiler (and consider adding the ESLint rule eslint-plugin-react-compiler to see violations the compiler will skip)

    Want maximum plugin compatibility (macros, custom Babel transforms) without the compiler?
      Pick plain TypeScript and add plugins as needed.
