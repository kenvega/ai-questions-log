question
  on react apps there is strict mode
  which mades my requests in effects run twice
  I understand that strict mode was created to detect bugs
  can you give me examples where you can
    show strict mode would allow me to see a possible bug

response
  StrictMode (dev-only) intentionally double-invokes some lifecycles and effects
    by doing a mount → unmount → mount cycle to smoke-test side effects

  example
    code example
      function Search() {
        useEffect(() => {
          const onKey = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
            if (e.key === "k" && (e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey)) {
              console.log("Open command palette");
            }
          };
          window.addEventListener("keydown", onKey);
          // ❌ no cleanup
        }, []);

        return null;
      }

    What StrictMode reveals
      after the remount, you now have two listeners
      press ⌘K and the log fires twice

    fixed code example
      useEffect(() => {
        const onKey = (e: KeyboardEvent) => { /* ... */ };
        window.addEventListener("keydown", onKey);
        return () => window.removeEventListener("keydown", onKey); // ✅ cleanup
      }, []);
