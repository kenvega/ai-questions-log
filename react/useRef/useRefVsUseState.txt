question
  useRef is used to store information that can persist through renders
  but useState hook already does that, right?
  what would be the difference then?
  there has to be some kind of advantage
  give me examples where
    - it's actually useful and better to use useRef in this case, instead of useState
    - it's not even better, it's actually necessary to use it
        that would be a great example to have as a reference

response

  useState persists and triggers re-renders

  useRef persists and does not re-render

  when to prefer useRef

    you need a mutable value that should not cause re-renders
    you need imperative access to a DOM node
    you need a stable "instance variable" across renders
    you must interact with non-react apis that expect an object reference

  rules of thumb

    UI should show the value → then use useState
    internal bookkeeping, timers, DOM, external instances → then use useRef

    changing a Ref never schedules a render; changing state always does
      so if your UI must show a value, that value must live in state and not in a Ref
      * remember: React only re-renders when state or props change
