question
  What is CommonJS vs ESM, in plain words?

response
  CommonJS (CJS) – the older Node style

    Uses require and module.exports.

    Was invented by Node before JavaScript had a standard module system.

    Key words:

      require(...)

      module.exports = ...

  ES Modules (ESM) – the modern standard

    Uses import and export.

    Part of the JavaScript language spec (works in browsers, Deno, Node, etc).

    Key words:

      import ... from

      export / export default

  Rough analogy

    CommonJS = “Node’s custom way of doing modules”.

    ESM = “Official JavaScript way of doing modules, works everywhere.”
