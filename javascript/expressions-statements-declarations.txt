question
  code that returns a value is called expression
  are there any other categories? what about code that defines a function, variable, or class?

response
  code that produces a value is called an expression
  code that performs an action but does not produce a value is called a statement
  code that introduces new identifiers (functions, variables, classes) is called a declaration


  Expressions:
    1 + 2
    x > 0 ? 'yes' : 'no'
    array.map(fn)
    myFunction()

  Statements:
    if (...) { ... }
    for (...) { ... }
    while (...) { ... }
    return
    break
    throw

  Declarations:
    let x = 5
    function foo() {}
    class A {}
    import ... from ...

  Most imperative languages (JavaScript, C, Java, Python) have these three categories.
  Functional languages (Haskell, Lisp) treat almost everything as an expression.
  Low-level languages (assembly) use the term instruction instead.

  In practice, nearly all code can be classified as expression, statement, or declaration.
