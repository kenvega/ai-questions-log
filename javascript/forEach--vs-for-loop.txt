  difference between a forEach and a for loop in js

response
  Here are the practical differences between forEach and a for loop in JavaScript

  Control flow (break/continue/return)

    for / for...of
      you can break, continue, and return (from the surrounding function)

    forEach
      you cannot break or continue
      A return only returns from the callback, not the outer function

    example
      // for: can break
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === "stop") break;
      }

      // forEach: can't break (this does NOT stop the loop)
      arr.forEach(x => {
        if (x === "stop") return; // only exits this callback invocation
      });

    If you need early exit, use for, for...of, or array methods like some / every.

  Async / await behavior

    for / for...of
      works naturally with await (sequential async)

    forEach
      does not await your async callback; it just fires callbacks and continues

    example
      // ✅ sequential
      for (const item of items) {
        await doWork(item);
      }

      // ❌ doesn't wait; starts them but doesn't await
      items.forEach(async (item) => {
        await doWork(item);
      });

    If you want parallel, use await Promise.all(items.map(doWork)).

  What they’re best for

    forEach
      “do something for each element” when you don’t need early exit, await, or index manipulation

    for
      maximum control (early exit, skipping, stepping by 2, iterating backwards, etc.)

follow up question
  does this includes the for loops like for..of and similars?

follow up response
  Yes — most of what I said applies to all the “for loops” family
    including for, for...of, and for...in, with a couple important nuances
