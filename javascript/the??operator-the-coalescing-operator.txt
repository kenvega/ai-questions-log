question
  what is the ?? operator in js

  how is it called?

  give me an example on where to use it
    what it is equivalent to?

response

  The ?? operator in JavaScript is the nullish coalescing operator

  It returns the right-hand side value
    only when
      the left-hand side is null or undefined
    otherwise
      it returns the left-hand side value

  example:
    this line

      const value = something ?? fallback;

    is basically the same as

      const value = (something !== null && something !== undefined) ? something : fallback;

  simple use case

    imagine you’re reading a setting that might be missing

      const userProvidedLimit = undefined; // could be null or undefined
      const limit = userProvidedLimit ?? 10;

      console.log(limit); // 10, because userProvidedLimit is undefined

    if userProvidedLimit was 0

      const userProvidedLimit = 0;
      const limit = userProvidedLimit ?? 10;

      console.log(limit); // 0 (it keeps 0 because it's NOT null/undefined)

  Why not just use ||?

    || treats any falsy value as “empty”: 0, "", false, NaN, null, undefined.

      example

        const count = 0;

        const a = count || 10; // 10, because 0 is falsy
        const b = count ?? 10; // 0, because 0 is NOT null/undefined

    So you use:

      || when any falsy value should trigger the default

      ?? when you only want the default if the value is missing (null or undefined)

  Typical real-world use

    Default config values without breaking on 0 or ""

      function createUser(options = {}) {
        const name = options.name ?? "Anonymous";
        const age = options.age ?? 18;
        const isAdmin = options.isAdmin ?? false;

        return { name, age, isAdmin };
      }

      createUser({ name: "", age: 0 });
      // name: ""   (keeps empty string)
      // age: 0     (keeps 0)
      // isAdmin: false (default)


    If you used || here
      the empty string and 0 would be replaced by the defaults, which is often not what you want.

    Summary

      Name: nullish coalescing operator (??)

      Use when: you want a default only if value is null or undefined

      Equivalent to:

          left ?? right
          // ≈
          (left !== null && left !== undefined) ? left : right

      || when any falsy value (0, "", false, NaN, null, undefined) should trigger the default

      ?? when you only want the default if the value is missing (null or undefined)
