question
  a callback is basically the same as a function?
  what is the difference? do one of them contains the other?

response
  a callback is not a different thing.
  it’s a function used as an argument and invoked by another function, immediately or later.
  “callback” describes a role.
  all callbacks are functions, not all functions are callbacks.

  key points:

    concept containment: callback ⊂ function usage.

    higher-order function: any function that receives a function (the callback).

    timing: callbacks can be synchronous (run now) or asynchronous (run later).

    naming by context: the same function may be called a handler, listener, predicate, mapper, reducer, comparator, executor, middleware, etc., depending on how it’s used.
