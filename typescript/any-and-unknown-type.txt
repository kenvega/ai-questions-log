question
  the any type was created for something?
  is there any good reason to use it in any case?
  if not then why it was created?
  what about the other type called 'unknown'?

response
  what any does
    disables type checking completely

  why it was created
    - to enable gradual typing and easy migration from plain javascript
    - to interoperate with untyped third-party code and dynamically shaped data

  about unknown type
    is safer than any because with any the errors are hidden because it disables type checking
    for unknown you can assign anything to it but you can use it unles you narrow it

  example
    function f(x: unknown) {
      if (typeof x === 'string') {
        x.toUpperCase();  // ok after guard
      }
    }

    function g(x: any) {
      x.notReal();  // compiles, may crash at runtime
    }
