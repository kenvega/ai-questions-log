question
  in this component:
    type ButtonProps = {
      // onIncrement: React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement>;
      onIncrement: () => void;
    };

    const ButtonWithoutContext = ({ onIncrement }: ButtonProps) => {
      return (
        <button type="button" className="button" onClick={onIncrement}>
          Increment button
        </button>
      );
    };

    export default ButtonWithoutContext;


  explain me why for the ButtonProps type we can use the line 2 or line 3 and both work
    and i don't get any issues with typescript?
    and if both are valid which one is the most recommended way to use?
    also why both are valid? is this a typescript bug?

  if you need more info btw its parent component is this one

    import * as React from "react";
    import DisplayWithoutContext from "./DisplayWithoutContext";
    import ButtonWithoutContext from "./ButtonWithoutContext";

    function CounterWithoutContext() {
      const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

      function onIncrement() {
        setCount(count + 1);
      }

      return (
        <div className="container">
          <h1>Counter Component without using context</h1>
          <DisplayWithoutContext count={count} />
          <ButtonWithoutContext onIncrement={onIncrement} />
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default CounterWithoutContext;

  i don't get why you can do both

  also what i don't understand as well is
    what really is React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement>
      is it a function? and object? why is that valid as a type?
      can you explain that as well?

response
  both work because
    React’s event handler types are intentionally flexible
    and JavaScript happily ignores extra arguments. It’s not a bug.

  what React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement> actually is
    it’s a type alias for a function

      takes a React SyntheticEvent (specifically a React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>)
      and returns void

      looks like this
        type MouseEventHandler<T = Element> = (event: React.MouseEvent<T>) => void

  React’s handler types are bivariant
    a function that ignores the event parameter is still acceptable

  Which should you prefer to use?

    Use `() => void` when
      the child doesn’t need the event object

      benefits
        simpler API
        decouples your component from DOM/React specifics
        easier to reuse and test

    Use `React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement>` when
      the child does need details from the click
        e.g.
          event.shiftKey
          event.currentTarget.disabled = true
          preventing default on links, etc.

  Think of it as intent vs. mechanism:

    () => void says “run this command when clicked.”

    MouseEventHandler says “give me the click event so I can inspect it.”
