response 

  response codes

    401 = authentication failed or missing. Include WWW-Authenticate. Client can retry with credentials. Use for missing, invalid, or expired token.

    403 = authenticated but not allowed. Permissions insufficient or access intentionally refused. Do not prompt for login.
      If credentials are valid but still not enough

  Not the only ones:

    407 Proxy Authentication Required. When a proxy needs credentials.

    511 Network Authentication Required. Captive portal or network login needed.

    400 Bad Request. Malformed auth header or token format.

    302/303/307 redirects. Often used by web apps to send users to a login page.

    404 Not Found. Sometimes used to avoid revealing that a protected resource exists.
