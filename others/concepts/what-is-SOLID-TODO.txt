question
  related to programming what is SOLID?
  give me an example with a popular app where it can be applied

response
  What is SOLID (in programming)?
    S — Single Responsibility: one class/module = one reason to change
    O — Open/Closed: open to extension, closed to modification
    L — Liskov Substitution: subclasses/implementations must be swappable without breaking behavior
    I — Interface Segregation: many small, purpose-specific interfaces > one fat interface
    D — Dependency Inversion: depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

  Example: Twitter/Instagram-style timeline

    Goal: show a user’s feed, with pluggable ranking (chronological, “friends first”, “ML ranked”), and swappable data source (SQL, REST, cache)
