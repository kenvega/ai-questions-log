question
  what is business logic related to programming?

  give me real life examples with companies and their applications they might use
    for example Uber, Discord, Whatsapp

  tell me which would be the business logic in every one of them

  and also to complement it tell me with which other related concept
    someone might confuse it as business logic in those cases
      but it's actually not that and it's another concept related with another name

response

  What “business logic” is (and isn’t)

    Business logic
      the rules that encode how the business creates/exchanges value:
        pricing, eligibility, limits, payouts, matching,
        prioritization, compliance policies, promotions, etc.

    It should read like policy:
      “If X, then do Y because that’s how our business works.”

  Not business logic (common confusions):

    UI/presentation logic
      how things look/feel (buttons, modals, formatting, animations)

    Application/orchestration logic
      wiring flows between components/APIs (controllers, job runners, retries)

    Infrastructure concerns
      DB schemas, caching, queues, Kubernetes, logging, sharding, failover

    Transport/protocol logic
      HTTP/WebSocket handling, gRPC contracts

    Security plumbing
      crypto primitives, OAuth handshakes, TLS, device binding.
        (Business rules about “who may do what” are business logic; the crypto to enforce it isn’t.)

  Real-world examples

    Uber (rides marketplace)
      Business logic (examples)

        Matching & dispatch rules
          which driver gets which trip (ETA, driver rating, vehicle class, driver/rider preferences)

        Dynamic pricing (“surge”)
          price multipliers based on supply/demand by geofence and time, caps/floors, driver pay splits

        Pooling constraints
          max detour minutes, pickup reorder limits, passenger count rules

        Cancellation & no-show fees
          when to charge, how much, who keeps what

        Incentives & promotions
          quests/bonuses eligibility, stacking rules, fraud guardrails

        Compliance gating
          city/airport regulations (license required? staging area rules?)

      Often confused with business logic (but not)

        Map rendering & turn-by-turn UI (presentation).

        GPS smoothing, route snapping (algorithms/infrastructure).

        Payment tokenization & 3-D Secure flows (payments infrastructure).

        Kubernetes autoscaling, Kafka topics (infra).

        SQL/ORM models and migrations (data access plumbing).
