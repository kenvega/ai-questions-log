question
  I've heard that Bun is a runtime but is also a package manager
  Is it both or maybe is it that there are two tools that actually does these separate tasks, but they are called the same?

  For example, I know that node is a runtime and NPN is a package manager

response
  Bun is both a JavaScript runtime and a package manager—and it’s mostly “one tool”
    in the sense that it ships as a single executable called bun with multiple subcommands

  How it maps to your Node/npm mental model

    Node = runtime (node)
    npm = package manager (npm) (usually distributed alongside Node, but still a separate CLI)

    Bun = runtime and toolkit in one (bun)

      runtime
        bun run ...

      package manager
        bun install, bun add, bun remove

      plus: test runner + bundler
              bun test, bun build, etc

  So it’s not “two separate tools that happen to share a name”
    it’s one CLI that does multiple jobs

  Can I use Bun’s package manager without using the Bun runtime?

    Yes

    Bun’s docs explicitly position the package manager as usable standalone
      and it can install a Node.js-compatible node_modules so you can keep running your app with Node
        while using bun install

  One small exception: bunx

    When you install Bun, you also get bunx
      which is basically an alias for bun x (like npx)

    It’s still part of the same Bun toolchain, just a convenience command
