question
  what happens if i have set zshrc and zsh_profile?
    does one takes priority?
      should i only have one? or is there reason why i should have both?
        are there any other files like that i should care about?

response
  short answer:
    both can exist and neither “wins” universally

    which one runs depends on how the shell is started, and later-read files can override earlier settings

  Who runs and in what order
    When zsh starts it reads files in this general sequence (system files first, then user files):

      /etc/zshenv then ~/.zshenv — always read for every zsh invocation (interactive, non-interactive, login, scripts).

      If it’s a login shell, next it reads /etc/zprofile then ~/.zprofile.

      If it’s interactive, it then reads /etc/zshrc then ~/.zshrc.

      If it’s a login shell, finally it reads /etc/zlogin then ~/.zlogin.

      On exit of a login shell it reads ~/.zlogout (and system /etc/zlogout if present).

    for an interactive login shell the user-file order is: ~/.zshenv → ~/.zprofile → ~/.zshrc → ~/.zlogin

    for a non-login interactive shell it’s ~/.zshenv → ~/.zshrc.

    for non-interactive shells (scripts) typically only ~/.zshenv is read

  Practical meaning / what to put where

    ~/.zshenv — put minimal, essential environment variables that must be available in every zsh invocation (e.g. PATH additions you rely on in scripts). Be careful: this runs for non-interactive shells too, so don’t put prompt settings, aliases or heavy logic here.

    ~/.zprofile — login-shell-only initialization. Good for things you want once-per-login-session (e.g. session-wide hooks, keyring/ssh-agent startup in some setups).

    ~/.zshrc — interactive-shell configuration: prompt, completions, aliases, key bindings, shell options (setopt), function definitions, plugin manager (oh-my-zsh, zinit, etc.). This is where most interactive users put config.

    ~/.zlogin — commands to run after ~/.zshrc for login shells (rarely needed; sometimes used for motd or last-minute session messages).

    ~/.zlogout — commands to run when a login shell exits.

  Does one “take priority”?

    Not exactly — files are read in order, so later files can override earlier ones
