question
  difference between 'session' and 'terminal'
  example context: temporary variables with EXPORT only work for a session of a terminal
  what would be a simple way to understand them both so is easy to differentiate them

response
  short answer
    a terminal is the app/window
    a session is the lifetime of the shell process running inside it

  simple model:
    Terminal = the screen and keyboard pipe (iTerm2, GNOME Terminal, Windows Terminal).
    Session = one shell process and its children (bash, zsh) from start to exit.

  why your export feels “temporary”:
    export VAR=1 marks VAR for inheritance by child processes of this shell
    it does not propagate to other shells or other terminal tabs
    it disappears when that shell process ends
