with openssl (built-in on macOS & Linux, installable on Windows)

  encrypt files
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in myfile.txt -out myfile.txt.enc

      -aes-256-cbc → strong AES encryption
      -salt → adds random data for stronger protection
      It will ask for a password — you’ll need the same password to decrypt.

  decrypt a file
    openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in myfile.txt.enc -out myfile_decrypted.txt

      -d means decrypt.
      Enter the same password you used when encrypting.

to remember
  once an image is encrypted with AES, there’s no way to preview it without decrypting it
  this works for any file type (JPG, PNG, ZIP, PDF, etc.).
  the .enc file will be unreadable without the password.
  AES-256-CBC is strong enough for personal and professional use.
  do not forget your password — there’s no recovery.
