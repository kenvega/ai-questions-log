question
  "HTML forms actually cause a navigation in the browser
    just like clicking a link."

  That is a quote from React Router Docs. What does this mean?
  Does this mean that, for example, the HTML forms can actually change the history?
  Can you expand on the details of this idea?
  What navigation in the browser means specifically?
  Does it has to do with history and something else?

  What “navigation” means

    A navigation is when the browser loads a (possibly new) document for a URL. That typically:
      - Sends an HTTP request to some URL
      - Replaces the current document with the response
      - Creates a session history entry (so Back/Forward works)
      - Fires page lifecycle events (validation → beforeunload → unload on the old page; then DOMContentLoaded/load on the new page)
      - Resets JS/DOM state, cancels timers/fetches, etc.

    * remember
        a navigation doesn’t always mean "go to a different URL"
          It means the browser performs a load/traversal operation in a browsing context
            The URL may change, but it doesn’t have to

  How a plain HTML <form> causes navigation

    By default, submitting a form:

      1. Runs constraint validation (required fields, patterns)
          if invalid → no navigation.

      2. If valid and not prevented by JS, the browser makes a request to the form’s action URL with the chosen method:
        - GET: encodes fields into the query string and requests action?field=value…
        - POST: sends fields in the request body

      3. The browser navigates to whatever resource is returned (that could be a new page, same page reloaded, a redirect, a file download, etc.).

    Form attributes that change where the navigation happens:

      action — the destination URL (defaults to the current page’s URL)

      method — GET (default) or POST

      target — '_self' (default, current tab), '_blank' (new tab), or a named <iframe> (navigates just that frame)

  Does it change history?

    Usually, yes. A submission pushes a new history entry, very much like clicking a normal <a href="…">

  When a submission does not navigate

    Your JS calls event.preventDefault() in the submit handler and uses fetch/XHR instead (common in SPAs).

    Validation fails (required, pattern, etc.).

    The server responds with special codes like 204 No Content (no document is replaced).

  How this relates to React Router

    React Router’s <Form> component intercepts the browser’s default navigation and:

      Sends the data via fetch (no full-document reload),

      Updates the URL and UI using the History API (pushState/replaceState)—a client-side navigation.

      Conceptually, though, React Router aligns with the platform idea that “submitting a form is a navigation,” it just performs it client-side so your app doesn’t reload.
